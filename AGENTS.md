# Sagents AI Library

This file provides guidance for Coding Agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Sagents library is a framework for integrating more advanced conversational AI Agents into Elixir applications.

It provides `mix task` generators for integrating more easily into an Elixir application. It provides advanced middleware for composably adding features to an agent..

It draws initial inspiration from LangChain Deep Agents library, but follows it's own path that aims for integration with Elixir ecosystem.

## Common Development Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Set up environment variables for API keys
cp .envrc_template .envrc
# Edit .envrc with API keys, then:
source .envrc
```

Never read the `.envrc` file as it contains developer secrets.

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests only (makes no external API calls)
mix test

# Run specific live API tests (billable and should be confirmed first)
mix test --include live_call
mix test --include live_anthropic

# Run a single test file
mix test test/path/to/test_file.exs

# Run a specific test by line number
mix test test/path/to/test_file.exs:42
```

### Code Quality

Always run this before committing:

```bash
# Performs a set of pre-commit steps of compile checks, formatting, running test, etc.
mix precommit
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Chat Models** (`lib/chat_models/`)
   - `ChatModel` behavior defines the interface for all LLM implementations
   - Each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) implements this behavior
   - Supports streaming, function calling, and multi-modal inputs

2. **Chains** (`lib/chains/`)
   - `LLMChain`: Primary abstraction for core orchestration of conversations and other LLM workflows
   - `DataExtractionChain`: Structured data extraction from text
   - `RoutingChain`: Dynamic routing based on input
   - Chains compose multiple operations and maintain conversation state

3. **Messages** (`lib/message.ex` and `lib/message/`)
   - `Message`: Core structure with roles (system, user, assistant, tool)
   - `ContentPart`: Handles multi-modal content (text, images, files)
   - `ToolCall` and `ToolResult`: Function invocation and results

4. **Functions** (`lib/function.ex`)
   - Integrates custom Elixir functions with LLMs
   - JSON Schema-based parameter validation
   - Context-aware execution with async support

### Key Patterns

- **Behavior-based design**: All chat models implement the `ChatModel` behavior
- **Ecto schemas**: Used for data validation and type casting throughout
- **Streaming support**: Built-in streaming capabilities for real-time responses
- **Error handling**: Consistent error tuples `{:ok, result}` / `{:error, reason}`

### Adding New Features

When adding a new LLM provider:
1. Create a new module in `lib/chat_models/`
2. Implement the `ChatModel` behavior
3. Add corresponding tests in `test/chat_models/`
4. Update documentation with supported features

When adding new chain types:
1. Create in `lib/chains/` following existing patterns
2. Use `Ecto.Schema` for configuration
3. Implement `run/2` function for execution
4. Add comprehensive tests including async scenarios

## Testing Guidelines

- Tests mirror the source structure (e.g., `lib/chains/llm_chain.ex` → `test/chains/llm_chain_test.exs`)
- Use `@tag :live_call` for tests requiring actual API calls
- Mock external dependencies using `Mimic` for unit tests
- Always test both sync and async execution paths when applicable

## Important Notes

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys. Use environment variables via `.envrc`
- **Live Tests**: Be cautious with live tests as they incur API costs
- **Multi-modal**: When working with messages, use `ContentPart` structures
- **Callbacks**: There are two callback systems that get combined into a single list of handler maps:
  1. **LangChain callbacks** — keys like `:on_llm_token_usage`, `:on_message_processed`, etc. These are added to the LLMChain via `add_callback/2` and fired by `LLMChain.run/2`. See `LangChain.Chains.ChainCallbacks` for valid keys.
  2. **Sagents-specific callbacks** — currently just `:on_after_middleware`, fired manually by `Agent.execute/3` after `before_model` hooks complete. Not a LangChain key.

  Both types live in the same list of maps passed via `callbacks: [map1, map2, ...]`. AgentServer builds this list by combining PubSub broadcast callbacks (`build_pubsub_callbacks/1`) with middleware callbacks (`Middleware.collect_callbacks/1`). All maps fire in fan-out: if two maps have the same key, both handlers fire. Middleware can declare LangChain callbacks via the `callbacks/1` behaviour callback.


## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input

### JS and CSS guidelines

- **Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules** to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.
- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js** and uses a new import syntax in `app.css`:

      @import "tailwindcss" source(none);
      @source "../css";
      @source "../js";
      @source "../../lib/my_app_web";

- **Always use and maintain this import syntax** in the app.css file for projects generated with `phx.new`
- **Never** use `@apply` when writing raw css
- **Always** manually write your own tailwind-based components instead of using daisyUI for a unique, world-class design
- Out of the box **only the app.js and app.css bundles are supported**
  - You cannot reference an external vendor'd script `src` or link `href` in the layouts
  - You must import the vendor deps into app.js and app.css to use them
  - **Never write inline <script>custom js</script> tags within templates**

### UI/UX & design guidelines

- **Produce world-class UI designs** with a focus on usability, aesthetics, and modern design principles
- Implement **subtle micro-interactions** (e.g., button hover effects, and smooth transitions)
- Ensure **clean typography, spacing, and layout balance** for a refined, premium look
- Focus on **delightful details** like hover effects, loading states, and smooth page transitions

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

## Test guidelines

- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

   - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages

# Usage Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Consult these usage rules early and often when working with the packages listed below.
Before attempting to use any of these packages or to discover if you should use them, review their
usage rules to understand the correct patterns, conventions, and best practices.
<!-- usage-rules-header-end -->



<!-- usage_rules-start -->
## usage_rules usage
_A dev tool for Elixir projects to gather LLM usage rules from dependencies_

## Using Usage Rules

Many packages have usage rules, which you should *thoroughly* consult before taking any
action. These usage rules contain guidelines and rules *directly from the package authors*.
They are your best source of knowledge for making decisions.

## Modules & functions in the current app and dependencies

When looking for docs for modules & functions that are dependencies of the current project,
or for Elixir itself, use `mix usage_rules.docs`

```
# Search a whole module
mix usage_rules.docs Enum

# Search a specific function
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip

# Search a specific function & arity
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip/1
```


## Searching Documentation

You should also consult the documentation of any tools you are using, early and often. The best
way to accomplish this is to use the `usage_rules.search_docs` mix task. Once you have
found what you are looking for, use the links in the search results to get more detail. For example:

```
# Search docs for all packages in the current application, including Elixir
mix usage_rules.search_docs Enum.zip

# Search docs for specific packages
mix usage_rules.search_docs Req.get -p req

# Search docs for multi-word queries
mix usage_rules.search_docs "making requests" -p req

# Search only in titles (useful for finding specific functions/modules)
mix usage_rules.search_docs "Enum.zip" --query-by title
```

<!-- usage_rules:elixir-start -->
## usage_rules:elixir usage
# Elixir Core Usage Rules

## Pattern Matching
- Use pattern matching over conditional logic when possible
- Prefer to match on function heads instead of using `if`/`else` or `case` in function bodies
- `%{}` matches ANY map, not just empty maps. Use `map_size(map) == 0` guard to check for truly empty maps

## Error Handling
- Use `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` tuples for operations that can fail
- Avoid raising exceptions for control flow
- Use `with` for chaining operations that return `{:ok, _}` or `{:error, _}`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Elixir has no `return` statement, nor early returns. The last expression in a block is always returned.
- Don't use `Enum` functions on large collections when `Stream` is more appropriate
- Avoid nested `case` statements - refactor to a single `case`, `with` or separate functions
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Lists and enumerables cannot be indexed with brackets. Use pattern matching or `Enum` functions
- Prefer `Enum` functions like `Enum.reduce` over recursion
- When recursion is necessary, prefer to use pattern matching in function heads for base case detection
- Using the process dictionary is typically a sign of unidiomatic code
- Only use macros if explicitly requested
- There are many useful standard library functions, prefer to use them where possible

## Function Design
- Use guard clauses: `when is_binary(name) and byte_size(name) > 0`
- Prefer multiple function clauses over complex conditional logic
- Name functions descriptively: `calculate_total_price/2` not `calc/2`
- Predicate function names should not start with `is` and should end in a question mark.
- Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards

## Data Structures
- Use structs over maps when the shape is known: `defstruct [:name, :age]`
- Prefer keyword lists for options: `[timeout: 5000, retries: 3]`
- Use maps for dynamic key-value data
- Prefer to prepend to lists `[new | list]` not `list ++ [new]`

## Mix Tasks

- Use `mix help` to list available mix tasks
- Use `mix help task_name` to get docs for an individual task
- Read the docs and options fully before using tasks

## Testing
- Run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` and a specific test with the line number `mix test path/to/test.exs:123`
- Limit the number of failed tests with `mix test --max-failures n`
- Use `@tag` to tag specific tests, and `mix test --only tag` to run only those tests
- Use `assert_raise` for testing expected exceptions: `assert_raise ArgumentError, fn -> invalid_function() end`
- Use `mix help test` to for full documentation on running tests

## Debugging

- Use `dbg/1` to print values while debugging. This will display the formatted value and other relevant information in the console.

<!-- usage_rules:elixir-end -->
<!-- usage_rules:otp-start -->
## usage_rules:otp usage
# OTP Usage Rules

## GenServer Best Practices
- Keep state simple and serializable
- Handle all expected messages explicitly
- Use `handle_continue/2` for post-init work
- Implement proper cleanup in `terminate/2` when necessary

## Process Communication
- Use `GenServer.call/3` for synchronous requests expecting replies
- Use `GenServer.cast/2` for fire-and-forget messages.
- When in doubt, use `call` over `cast`, to ensure back-pressure
- Set appropriate timeouts for `call/3` operations

## Fault Tolerance
- Set up processes such that they can handle crashing and being restarted by supervisors
- Use `:max_restarts` and `:max_seconds` to prevent restart loops

## Task and Async
- Use `Task.Supervisor` for better fault tolerance
- Handle task failures with `Task.yield/2` or `Task.shutdown/2`
- Set appropriate task timeouts
- Use `Task.async_stream/3` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure
